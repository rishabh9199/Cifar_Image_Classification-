# Cifar_Image_Classification-
A machine learning project that examined the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms on cifar dataset which includes 60000 images classified into 10 different claase. Different Machine learning algorithms used are random forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN. The same model was performed using PCA and CNN for better accuracy and results.
